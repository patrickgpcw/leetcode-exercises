## Duplicate Integer

Given two strings `s` and `t`, `return` true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return `false`.

An <b>anagram</b> is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

####  Example 1:
```bash
Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"

Output: true
```
#### Example 2:
```bash
Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"

Output: false
```
#### Constraints:
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters
